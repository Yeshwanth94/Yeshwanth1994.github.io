I am a fourth year Ph.D candidate in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/ Peter Bartlett]. I'm broadly interested in algorithmic and statistical issues arising in machine learning. Before this, I'd spent two wonderful years as a research fellow in the Machine Learning & Optimization group at Microsoft Research, India, where I was fortunate to work with [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/ Prateek Jain], [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/ Praneeth Netrapalli] and Nagarajan Natarajan on designing provable algorithms for non-convex optimization. Previously, I received a B. Tech in Computer Science from IIT Bombay where I worked on Entity Linking and Disambiguation with [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/ Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan] and [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/ Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti] for my undergraduate thesis.
