I am a third year Ph.D student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/ Prof. Peter Bartlett]. I'm broadly interested in statistical and computational issues arising in machine learning, focusing on the development of efficient algorithms and computational lower bounds. Previously, I'd spent two wonderful years as a research fellow in the Machine Learning & Optimization group at Microsoft Research, India, where I was fortunate to work with [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/ Dr. Prateek Jain], [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/ Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli] and Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan on provable non-convex algorithms for machine learning. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at [http://www.iitb.ac.in/ IIT Bombay] where I obtained my B. Tech in Computer Science in 2015. I worked on Entity Linking and Disambiguation with [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/ Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan] and [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/ Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti] for my undergraduate thesis.
